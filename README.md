   How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
    
   I found the best way to garner feedback from consumers is by employing the use of interviews, either one on one or in a group setting withm ultiple customers. I would prefer the group setting as other users can piggyback off of each other and provide additional insight into what features they would like to see. User stories help in gathering all of this data and organzing it in a way that is easier to understand and sort by importance.  
    
   How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
   
   Developing programs is a lot of trial, error, and research. Beign able to adapt on the fly is key as requiremtns may change at any time depending on the work envirnment and problems that you never expect to occur, will. Being able to implement aspects of agile into your everyday work load aids in all of these aspects by allowing the programmer to be flexible.
   
   What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

  Being a good team member entails good communication skills, workload competency, and knowing when to reign in your skills as to not overwork yourself. A good software developer takes client fedback to heart, provides suggestions on changes to improve the product, as well as being a team player to provide help wherever it is needed.
